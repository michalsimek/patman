"""Run Coverity static analysis on a series and find new defects

Coverity works on a whole build rather than a diff, so to find the
defects a series introduces we analyse the base tree and the patched
tree separately and compare. Each Coverity defect carries a stable
'mergeKey' that identifies the same defect across builds, so the new
defects are those whose mergeKey is not present in the base.

The cov-build, cov-analyze and cov-format-errors tools must be on the
PATH; they are part of a (commercial) Coverity installation.
